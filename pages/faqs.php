		                                    Dressy casual. That basically means business-casual but cooler and classier; essentially, just wear what you would wear to attend a nice dinner party with friends. Whatever you wear, make sure it's a cut above your normal day-to-day attire, while still comfortable enough that you can imagine dancing the Macarena in it. Over. And over. And over. And over. And over. And over again.

		                                    <br>Guys, jeans are okay so long as they are clean and pressed. Shorts and t-shirts aren't. It might be "casual", but it isn't lazy-Sunday-binging-Netflix casual. Leave the sweatpants, the shorts, the bathrobe, the t-shirt, and the pajama-onesie at home. At the same time, there's no need for tuxes, tophats, or monocles; but DO wear a button-up shirt, or a nice polo, coupled with slacks, trousers, or nice jeans. Class it up with a sportcoat, or throw on a vest. And hey, even though you don't NEED to wear a tie, we ain't gonna tell you not to.

		                                    <br>Ladies, no need to wear heels tonight, and no need to  wear something formal enough that you could walk straight from our wedding and into an episode of The Crown. Dresses are generally the order of the day, although you have some solid flexibility within this dress code. Check out the links below, for some better insight.
