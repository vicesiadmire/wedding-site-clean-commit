		            // BELOW: leaving the "for" attribute out because it would need to be bound to the input's ID and if I put an ID in the input then we'll have a whole mess o' the same ID floating around on the page, so instead I'll just wrap the label around it to make sure that it is connected
		            // BELOW: also, not including a name on the displayed buttons, because the values in those won't be submitted anyhow. I only want to submit data in the 'HIDDEN' inputs above them. I'll change the values with javascript when a button is clicked. I'm using buttons because those seem a bit easier to style and seem to make more sense. Well, a 'radio' would make more sense, but those are impossible to use since if I used them, in order to prevent another from being clicked, I'd have to give them the same name which then means, in this form at least, everytime I select one, I can't select another -- in ANYONE'S options. I could just allow people to select any one they want, but then I would have to hide them and style the labels with css anyhow. Why not just skip that whole mess and simply make a button that, when selected, changes the value in a hidden input which will let me update the correct column
